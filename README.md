# myData-Science
My ML project to estimate the used car price based on the data scrapped from car finding sites (ideally would need final sell price).
The most of the code is from reference github repo, I did a modification so user can enter their car parameters to get the estimated price along with some fine tuning and learnings based on reading. 

This was precursor to Find Home Price project..

 
How to run ?</br> 
python dbEstimat.py estYear estMTO* estMileage </br> 
e.g. python dbEstimat.py 2018 2 50000

*estMTO = 1-5 value based on car' features 5 being max package, see CSV file 

I used this for my recent buy and was offered close to estimate :)
